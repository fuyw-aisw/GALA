# Learning A Generalized Graph Transformer for Protein Function Prediction in Dissimilar Sequences
---
## Overview
In this work, we propose a new generalized approach named Graph Adversarial Learning with Alignment (GALA) for protein function prediction. To encode all these proteins from different environments, our GALA utilizes a graph Transformer architecture with the attention mechanism for unified protein representations. More importantly, GALA introduces a domain discriminator conditioned on both representations and predicted labels, which is adversarially trained to ensure the invariance of representation across different environments. To make the best of label information, we generate label embeddings in the hidden space, which would be aligned explicitly with protein representations. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and our GALA can outperform all the compared baselines with high generalizability.

## Protein Function Prediction
To predict protein functions use `predict.py` script with the following options:
* `device`             str, choose the available cuda
* `task`            str,  default='bp', choose from three gene ontology tasks ['mf','bp','cc']
* `pdb`             str, path of the input query pdb file
* `only_pdbch`   str2bool, default=False, True means use the model parameters trained only on PDBch training set, False means use the model parameters trained on PDBch and AFch combined training set
* `prob`  float, default=0.5, choose a threshold, and then output the protein function with predicted probability above the threshold
### Predicting functions of protein 1P4U-A on BP-GO term:
```bash
python predictor.py --device 0 --task bp --pdb data/1P4U-A.pdb --only_pdbch False --prob 0.5
```

## Model Training
### Data preparation
Our dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/E5DFEA3B9F95E679F76DEC9061872BB2).
```bash
unzip prot30.zip -d ../GALA/data/
```
The dataset related files will be under `../GALA/data/prot30`. 
Files with prefix of `AF2` belong to AFch dataset, others belong to PDBch dataset.
Files with suffix of `pdbch` record the PDBid or uniprot accession of each protein, and files with suffix of `graph` contain the graph we constructed for each protein.
